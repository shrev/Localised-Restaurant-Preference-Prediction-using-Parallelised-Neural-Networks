# Localised-Restaurant-Preference-Prediction-using-Parallelised-Neural-Networks

The fast-food chain industry has seen accelerated growth, with growing market share
and a multitude of customers. However, the dramatic increase in the number of such
chains, has caused a steep increase in competition- forcing businesses to either
innovate, or fail.
Our model thus analyses consumer sentiments, to detect the parameters that cause
both positive, and negative reviews for a chain. The neural network learns to segregate
user views based on parameters like ambiance, and consistent food quality, to predict
which restaurant a consumer prefers.
